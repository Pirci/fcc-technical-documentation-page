            Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is an action-adventure video game series
            created by David Jones and Mike Dailly;[2] the later titles of which
            were created by brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and
            Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by British development house
            Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its parent
            company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series references the term
            "grand theft auto", used in the U.S. for motor vehicle theft.
          </p>

          <p>
            DMA Design began the series in 1997, with the release of the
            original Grand Theft Auto. As of 2019, the series has eleven
            stand-alone games and four expansion packs. The third chronological
            title, Grand Theft Auto III, is considered a landmark title, as it
            brought the series to a 3D setting and more immersive experience.
            Subsequent titles have followed and built upon the concept
            established in Grand Theft Auto III, and received significant
            acclaim. They have influenced other open-world action games, and led
            to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar games.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Each game in this series allows the player to take on the role of
              a criminal in the big city, typically an individual who plans to
              rise through the ranks of organised crime through the course of
              the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Occasionally taxi driving, firefighting, street racing, bus
              driving, or learning to fly helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft
              are also involved in the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Grand Theft Auto series belongs to a genre of free-roaming
              role-playing video games called open world games, and grants a
              large amount of freedom to the player.

            Each game in this series allows the player to take on the role of a
            criminal in the big city, typically an individual who plans to rise
            through the ranks of organised crime through the course of the game.
            The player is given various missions by kingpins and major idols in
            the city underworld which must be completed to progress through the
            storyline. Assassinations and other violent crimes are featured
            regularly. Occasionally taxi driving, firefighting, street racing,
            bus driving, or learning to fly helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft
            are also involved in the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            In later titles, notably those released after Grand Theft Auto 2,
            the player is given a more developed storyline in which they are
            forced to overcome an unfortunate event (e.g., being betrayed and
            left for dead), which serves as motivation for the character to
            advance up the criminal ladder and ultimately leads to the triumph
            of the character by the end of the storyline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grand Theft Auto III and subsequent games have more voice acting and
            radio stations, which simulate driving to music with disc jockeys,
            radio personalities, commercials, talk radio, pop music, and
            American culture.

          The Grand Theft Auto series is set in a fictional version of the
          world, in a number of different time periods. The original Grand Theft
          Auto introduced three main cities: Liberty City, based upon New York
          City, Vice City, based upon Miami, and San Andreas, based upon mostly
          parts of California. In the first Grand Theft Auto game, San Andreas
          was based on San Francisco and parts of Las Vegas. Expansion packs
          later set the game in London. Select the code in the pad and hit

          Grand Theft Auto Double Pack was released in 2003 for the PlayStation
          2 and Xbox. It includes Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City.[32] Grand
          Theft Auto: The Trilogy is a compilation of III, Vice City, and San
          Andreas. The compilation was first released in 2005 for the Xbox.[33]
          Later it was released for the PlayStation 2, Windows, Mac OS X, and
          PlayStation 4.[34][35][36][37] The Trilogy also served as the revised
          package for San Andreas, which had to be pulled from shelves due to
          the controversial Hot Coffee mod.[38]
        </p>
        <p>
          Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a standalone
          compilation of the episodes for Grand Theft Auto IV. It contains both
          The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony on one disc. It was
          released on 29 October 2009 for the Xbox 360 and on 13 April 2010 for
          Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3. Microsoft added Episodes from
          Liberty City to its backwards compatibility list for Xbox One
          platforms in February 2017.

            The game was controversial from the very first incarnation of the
            series.[64] Grand Theft Auto was condemned in Britain, Germany, and
            France due to its "extreme violence",[65] and Brazil banned it
            outright.[65] Publicist Max Clifford planted sensational stories in
            tabloids in order to help sell the first game.[64][66][67]

          <p>
            The controversies flared up again with Grand Theft Auto III, since
            the 3D graphics made the violence more realistic, and players could
            pay for the services of prostitutes to restore their health, and if
            they wished, kill them to get some of their money back.[67]
          </p>

          <p>
            There is also criticism from the focus on illegal activities in
            comparison with traditional "heroic" roles that other games offer.
            The main character can commit a wide variety of crimes and violent
            acts while dealing with only temporary consequences, including the
            killing of policemen and military personnel.

            The sixth game in the series, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, also came
            under criticism. One mission in particular, in which the player must
            instigate a gang war between Haitian and Cuban gangs, has been
            controversial. Haitian and Cuban anti-defamation groups criticised
            the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jean-Robert Lafortune of the Haitian American Grassroots Coalition
            is quoted as saying that "The game shouldn't be designed to destroy
            human life, it shouldn't be designed to destroy an ethnic group,"
            for this and similar scenarios, including lines in the game's script
            such as "kill the Haitian dickheads" said by character "Diaz" during
            an altercation between the player and a Haitian gang. After the
            threat of a lawsuit by the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition,
            Rockstar removed the word "Haitians" from this phrase in the game's
            subtitles.

            San Andreas was criticised initially due to its "gangster" elements,
            which include drugs, prostitution, and murder. Later it received
            additional criticism after the discovery of an interactive sex
            minigame, nicknamed Hot Coffee; initially cut from the game, it
            remained in the game code, and was discovered in both the console
            and Windows versions of the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, modders managed
            to find the unused code in the game and released unofficial patches
            for the Windows and Xbox (with a modchip) versions as well as a
            PlayStation 2 version through the use of an Action Replay code
            enabling the player to engage in these sexual mini-games (dubbed
            "Hot Coffee" in reference to a euphemism for sex used in the game).
            These mini-games were left partially intact in the game's code. This
            prompted application of an AO (Adults Only) ESRB rating to the
            version of the game containing the leftover code. Take-Two
            Interactive was forced to re-release the game in order to restore
            the M (Mature) rating. A class action lawsuit against Take-Two was
            also filed as a result of the "Hot Coffee" code.

            <p>
              One of the controversies involved with this game was Mothers
              Against Drunk Driving's (MADD) criticism of the ability to drink
              and drive as a new feature. MADD had even requested ESRB to change
              the rating of the game from "M" for ages seventeen and up to "AO",
              for adults only, because they felt it was inappropriate for
              children, even at the age of seventeen, to experience drunk
              driving in such a manner.
            </p>
          </ul>
          Notably, it is impossible to drive while drunk in the GTA IV
          expansions, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. These were
          released after the criticism. It is, however, possible to drive drunk
          again in the successor, Grand Theft Auto V.

            The Lost and Damned expansion pack for Grand Theft Auto IV was
            condemned by US parents group Common Sense Media who issued a public
            warning against the pack's content due to a full-frontal nudity
            scene during one of the cutscenes. They claimed the game was "more
            controversial than its predecessors" because it featured "full
            frontal male nudity".

          A segment in the latest instalment caused controversy for scenes
          containing player initiated torture. The mission "By the Book"
          features graphic depictions of kneecapping, electrocution, dental
          extraction and waterboarding, and the player is required to perform an
          act of torture in order to progress in the game.[78][79][80]

          <code></code>

          <p>
            UK-based charity Freedom from Torture publicly condemned the use of
            torture scenes in Grand Theft Auto V. The organisation, who works to
            rehabilitate survivors of torture, joined other human rights
            charities who were outraged at a torture scene in the game in which
            the players have to pull teeth and electrocute an unarmed man in
            order to extract information. The charity's CEO Keith Best stated:
            “Rockstar North has crossed a line by effectively forcing people to
            take on the role of a torturer and perform a series of unspeakable
            acts if they want to achieve success in the game."[78]
          </p>

          <p>
            The game has also been accused of sexism. The Los Angeles Times
            considered the game's satirical portrayals of women uncreative, and
            added that violent and sexist themes hurt the game experience.[81]
            Edge noted that while "every female in the game exists solely to be
            sneered, leered or laughed at", it treated its all-male lead
            characters in a similar vein through their stereotyped tendencies
            towards violence.[82] Sam Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder, felt
            that the development team sometimes overlooked their portrayal of
            women in Grand Theft Auto games, but that the weight towards male
            characters "fit with the story we wanted to tell".[83]

          Ever since the release of Grand Theft Auto III in 2001, the Grand
          Theft Auto series has been a major success, both critically and
          financially. It has generated perfect or near perfect reviews and
          scores on almost all of the games; by September 2013, the series sold
          over 150 million copies worldwide,[166] and as of August 2015, Grand
          Theft Auto shipped over 220 million units worldwide.[6] The Times
          Online reported that Grand Theft Auto IV recorded 609,000 copies in
          the UK on its first day of release.[167] In its first week, Grand
          Theft Auto IV sold approximately 6 million copies worldwide and
          grossed over $500 million.[168]
          <p>
            In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was voted one of Britain's top 10 designs
            in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the
            Design Museum. The game appeared in a list of British design icons
            which included Concorde, Jaguar E-Type, Aston Martin DB5, Mini,
            World Wide Web, Tomb Raider, K2 telephone box, London tube map, AEC
            Routemaster bus and the Supermarine Spitfire.
          </p>

          <p>
            The series has broken several records, resulting in Guinness World
            Records awarding the series 10 world records in the Gamer's Edition
            2008. These records include Most Guest Stars in a Video Game Series,
            Largest Voice Cast in a Video Game (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas),
            Largest In-Game Soundtrack (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) as well
            as Most Successful Entertainment Launch of All Time (Grand Theft
            Auto V). Guinness World Records also ranked Grand Theft Auto in
            third place on their list of top 50 console games of all time based
            on initial impact and lasting legacy.[170] Grand Theft Auto: San
            Andreas is listed as the most successful game on the PlayStation 2
            according to The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition.
